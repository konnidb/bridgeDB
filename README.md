# BridgeDB

BridgeDB is an opensource Graph based database with a NoSQL approach.
It's name comes from the Bridge problem of KÃ¶nigsberg, a famous problem which solution uses Graph theory. The motivation behind BridgeDB was an school project where we needed to find a way to store data using simple binary files and then load them in memory in a structure where we could do graph operations such as pattern recognition, shortest paths, MSTs, etc. After spending a few months thinking about creating a language similar to Cypher from Neo4j we decided to move on creating an RPC server where we could easely call our methods using HTTP 2.

Feel free to look at the code, critique, and give feedback based on knowledge and experience.

### Note
This project is in a very early stage of development and our goal here is to implement a file system optimized to do graph operations when information is loaded on memory. Our system sill has a lot of pitfalls and our projection is to fix them in a short to medium period of time.

Also as part of being an school project, our main goal is to make this work in an stable way and make it available to everyone disposed to use our.

### Creating a database

In BridgeDB we have three concepts needed to operate on the database.
- Token
- Database
- Graph

Every time you create an instance of BridgeDB you need to create a token using the RPC method called `CreateSession`. This method generates a token using a SHA256 algorithm. After the database will be configured and you can start to perform operations, operations defined in the `src/network/network.proto` file.
